## CollectionsLet 1.0

CollectionsLet is my own implemenation of the Java Collections interface. The goal is to recreate the core interfaces and classes (like List, Set, Map, and Deque) and implement their most commonly used methods.

This project is designed for learning and practicing object-oriented design, data structure implementation.

## CollectionsLet Overview

The CollectionsLet interface defines common methods shared across all collection interfaces.

The CollectionsLet interface is extended by four interfaces:

- List<E> 

- Set<E>
  
- Map<K, V>

- Deque<E> 

Each interface (List, Set, Map, and Deque) inherits from the base CollectionsLet interface.

Each interface is implemented by specific classes. For example, the List interface is implemented by LinkedList and ArrayList.
